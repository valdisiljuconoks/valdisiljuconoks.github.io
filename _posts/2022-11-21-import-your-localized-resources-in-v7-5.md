Import functionality has been delayed for several versions of `DbLocalizationProvider`. However, with the help of [community member](https://github.com/ruwen) - this feature has finally been implemented!

"Import Resources" feature is now available in [v7.5](https://nuget.optimizely.com/package/?id=DbLocalizationProvider.AdminUI.EPiServer). It also gives you "Preview" before importing resources with an option to select only part of the changes detected from the import file.

Feel free to send feedback or feature requests on [the project site](https://github.com/valdisiljuconoks/LocalizationProvider)!

Happy importing!
